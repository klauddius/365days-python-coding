# 365 Days Coding in Python

## Context and Scope

As a lifelong learner, I started learning Python to get proficient in using this language. One best way to learn 
something new is to read about it and start practicing what you read. Based on this method, this repository contains all
the exercises I'm doing to complete my 365 days of coding in Python. The exercises will be collected from sites over the
internet and mentioned in the list below.
